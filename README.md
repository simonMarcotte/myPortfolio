# My Personal Portfoio Website

This website was created using React.js and Talwind CSS.

On this website, you can learn more about who I am, what I do and what I have done, and how to contact me.
To change between light and dark mode, click the icon on the top right on the navigation bar.
To go to each of my sections, simply click the sections labels on the navigation bar, and the website will auto-scroll down to that section.
In the skills section, hover on desktop or click on mobile on any of the skills, to see a brief description on how I have used that particular tool, and a bonus glow colour :).

# Known Bugs:
- When zoomed out past 100%, the 'resume' button does not work as intended
- The 'Contact' button on the navigation bar does not scroll to the bottom of the website to my contact information. Please scroll to the bottom of the website instead.
